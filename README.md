Code accompanying the paper: Wimmer, G. E., Liu, Y., Vehar, N., Behrens, T. E., & Dolan, R. J. (2019). Episodic memory retrieval success is associated with rapid replay of episode content. bioRxiv, 758185.

# memory-sequences
The simulation code for the whole analysis pipeline is located in

``` SeqSimRand_v1.m ```

The simulation is used to determine the empirical null distrbution (for the "after" and "before" conditions) for the relationship between sequenceness and memory retrieval success given noise input.
